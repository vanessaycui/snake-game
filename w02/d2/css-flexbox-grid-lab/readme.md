## Setup

Attempt to do the lab in this repo, but if you prefer to use repl.it, you can copy over the images from here.

1. Inside this folder, create an `index.html` file.<br>
2. Inside this folder, create a `style.css` file.<br>
3. Add the boilerplate to your html file.<br>
4. Connect your CSS file to your HTML file and make sure that it is attached (hint: give the body a background color temporarily)<br>
5. NOTE: All images you'll need to recreate the mockup are provided for you in the `img` folder

Before diving in: Review what wireframing is and how to use it for building a layout with HTML and CSS.
