# Merge Sorted Arrays

We have two sorted arrays `list1` and `list2`.

Write a function that takes in both arrays and returns a new sorted array with all the elements from the two input arrays.

```javascript
const list1 = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15];
const list2 = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19];

console.log(mergeArrays(list1, list2));
// logs [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]
```
