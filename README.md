# **SNAKE**

Snake is a nostalgic game for me. I used to play on my cousin's Nokia back in the 90's during family dinners. I decided to create my own version of Snake so I can tinker with the settings.

This version of snake includes the following features:
* Moving boosters (increases score by 10 points)
* Static poisonous food (decreases score by 5 points)
* Static food (increases score by 1 point)
* Top scores will be stored in the user's localStorage in their browser

***Please note: SNAKE is optimized for playing in a Chrome browser window with a minimum width of 600px and minimum height of 810px. User will need access to a keyboard with arrow keys! Stay tuned for a mobile-friendly version of this game in the near future!***
