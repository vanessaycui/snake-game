# CSS Selectors Lab

## This lab is a deliverable

## Learning Goals
* tag/element selectors
* class selectors
* id selectors
* descendent selectors
* specificity

## Getting started

1. Open the `index.html` file by double clicking
2. Go to your browser, `cmd-o` (mac) / `ctrl-o` (linux) to open `index.html` in your browser

## Instructions

The assignment instructions are written directly in `index.html`. **Before you make any changes read through the code first!** You'll find comments in the code that will help you explore the difference between CSS Reset and Normalize before you begin working with the CSS selectors.

### Workflow

First you'll need to link `styles.css` to `index.html`.

* Read the exercise instructions in `index.html`
* Write your code in `styles.css`
* Refresh your browser to see if your changes worked
* Repeat for next exercise


## Submit your assignment

When you're done playing around with this document, submit the link for this folder to the links repo


## Stretch: Add web fonts to the page

Rather than using a font stack based on built-in fonts, you can use web fonts to broaden the possible fonts and customize your document to your design. Take a look at https://fonts.google.com/ and figure out how to use the fonts listed there in your document.
