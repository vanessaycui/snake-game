# Big O Notation

## Overview
This lesson covers the basics of Big O notation.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/)
2. In-Class Exercise: [Analyzing Algorithms](BigOExercise.md)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Explain how Big O notation is used to describe algorithms.
- Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
- Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.

## Prerequisites
* None

## Additional Resources
- [The Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) is the authority on Big O complexities.
