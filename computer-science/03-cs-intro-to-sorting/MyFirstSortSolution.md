# My First Sort Solution
Below are answers to the discussion questions for each card sorting exercise.

## Bubble Sort

```
1. How fast was this sort? Fast, slow, medium?
    * Slow
2. Did you require any extra space besides the space that the cards were originally laid out in?
    * No
3. What effect did it have on the end result that you did not swap "ties" (e.g., a 5 of hearts and a 5 of diamonds)?
    * It stayed in original order
4. How fast or slow would it be to sort cards that start out already in order?
    * Relatively fast
5. How fast or slow would it be to sort cards that start out in completely reversed order?
    * Very slow
6. Hypothetically, if you wanted to sort by suits (e.g., clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades) and then by card value, how would your swap/comparison logic change?
    * Another conditional or a compound conditional
7. Given your answers to the previous questions, hazard a guess at what this sort's stats are:
    * Best-case time complexity (Big 立)?
        * 立(n)
    * Worst-case time complexity (Big O)?
        * O(n^2)
    * Space complexity (Big O)?
        * O(1)
    * Stable or unstable sort?
        * Stable       
```

## Insertion Sort

```
1. How fast was this sort? Fast, slow, medium?
    * Slow, but not as slow as bubble sort
2. Did you require any extra space besides the space that the cards were originally laid out in?
    * Yes
3. What effect did it have on the end result that you did not swap "ties" (e.g., a 5 of hearts and a 5 of diamonds)?
    * It stayed in order
4. How fast or slow would it be to sort cards that start out already in order?
    * Relatively fast
5. How fast or slow would it be to sort cards that start out in completely reversed order?
    * Relatively slow
6. Hypothetically, if you wanted to sort by suits (e.g., clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades) and then by card value, how would your swap/comparison logic change?
    * Another conditional
7. Given your answers to the previous questions, hazard a guess at what this sort's stats are:
    * Best-case time complexity (Big 立)?
        * 立(n)
    * Worst-case time complexity (Big O)?
        * O(n^2)
    * Space complexity (Big O)?
        * O(1)
    * Is this a stable or unstable sort?
        * Stable
